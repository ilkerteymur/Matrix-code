What is HTML Canvas?
The HTML <canvas> element is used to draw graphics, on the fly, via JavaScript.

The <canvas> element is only a container for graphics. You must use JavaScript to actually draw the graphics.

Canvas has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and adding images.

- Example: "<canvas id="myCanvas" width="200" height="100"></canvas>"
